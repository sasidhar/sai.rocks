            Following is the general workflow of working with a GitHub Git
            Repository.
        </p>

        <h3>One Time Configuration</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Get the URL of your code repository. For this you can click on
                the green Code button and you can press the little clipboard
                icon. This will copy the URL
            </li>
            <li>
                Open your terminal. Type git clone Copied-URL-here. With this
                you will have the git repository in your local machine
            </li>
            <li>
                Go to the clon let Git know who we are. This information will be
                used when we make any code commits. There is two sets of
                information we need to give.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First one is: Your name. For this use the command: git
                        config user.name "Your Name Here"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Second one is: Your email. For this use the command: git
                        config user.email "Your Email Here". Make sure that this
                        email matches with your Github account email.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All the settings that we make till now needs to done only once. We
            don't need to repeat this every time.
        </p>

        <h3>Code Changes and Updates</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Open terminal</li>
            <li>Go to your repository folder</li>
            <li>Check status using the command: git status</li>
            <li>
                Open your code base in Visual Studio Code. Use code . for this.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make all the required changes you want. The changes may include
                adding/editing/deleting files/text.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can move back to the terminal and check the current git
                status using: git status. It will list what are the changes that
                are pending a commit or pushing to the repository
            </li>
            <li>
                In Visual Studio Code, on the left side, there is a Git button.
                You can click that and see what are the files modified.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can also click on each file and see the changes that you
                made in each of those files
            </li>
            <li>
                Once everything looks good and as per your requirements, then
                Stage those files for commit. For this you need to press the "+"
                button next to each file. If you have 5 files. And if you want
                to commit only one file. Then press the "+" button only next to
                that file. This step is called staging.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once you staged the files for commit, then you can add a message
                in the top text input. Then press the "Tick" mark button next to
                it. or Control + Enter. This will commit your staged changes.
                Remember: All you commits are still in your local machine. They
                are not yet pushed to the Github repository.
            </li>
            <li>
                Now to push these commits to the repository, in VS Code in the
                same Git tab, click on the Sync button at the bottom. The Sync
                button is shown with a circle with two arrows. Here it may ask
                for your username and/or password.
            </li>
        </ul>
